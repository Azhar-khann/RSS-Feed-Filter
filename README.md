# RSS-Feed-Filter

This project utilizes object-oriented programming principles, specifically classes and inheritance, to create a program that monitors news feeds over the Internet. 
The program's primary function is to filter news stories and alert the user whenever it detects a story matching their specified interests. For instance, the user may receive a 
notification whenever a news story related to the Red Sox is posted.

## Features

- **Object-Oriented Design:** The program is structured using classes and inheritance, making it modular, scalable, and easy to maintain.

- **News Feed Monitoring:** The core functionality involves monitoring news feeds over the Internet.

- **Interest-Based Filtering:** Users can set their interests, and the program will alert them when a news story aligns with those interests.
